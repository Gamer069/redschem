- [ ] setup git
- [ ] add search to frontend
- [ ] fix frontend styling so its VERY good
- [ ] add different themes in frontend so its not always just catppuccin mocha
- [ ] somehow deal with the extra data in <Schematic/> properly - if it's too long then the tile will be like 50km long and we dont want that - maybe make it scrollable and open up like a <code> style thing so it doesn't take up much space?

- [ ] add literally all schematics just to see if it will work in prod
- [ ] more spacing between rows in the schematic component in frontend
- [ ] drop db/dont duplicate items
- [ ] nicer code
- [ ] good logging
- [ ] docs (maybe later)
- [ ] more comments
- [ ] rate limiting
- [ ] error handling for invalid headers
- [ ] get a response from the one, AND ONLY, @mattbatwings on lrs discord
